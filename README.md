# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This is the very first iteration of my online portfolio created using Bootstrap as part of my EdX bootcamp.

This challenge forced me to completely create a website using HTML and Bootstrap from scratch and I learned a lot in the process, I had to relearn a lot of things I'd already learned such as columns and rows -- which in bootstrap now go in the HTML in the div class instead of the css.

# Usage
When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. You will also see a logo animation I made in Adobe Illustrator and After Effects which in the future will say my full name.

When one of the links in the navigation bar is clicked, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

When viewing the section about my work, the section contains titled images of my applications.

When presented with my first application, that application's image is larger in size than the others.

When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

# To come
In a future iteration, more projects will be added instead of the placeholder that are there.
